**setup.sh, Procfile, and requirements.txt** are for the web deployment.


to launch the app from a local runtime, yo just have to write:


`streamlit run index.py`


**index.py** is the *main* file.


**func.py** is the file with *all* the functions.


**pages.py** is the file where the streamlit pages are *generated*, the data is *loaded*, and the functions *called*.


**config.toml** has the general style configuration used in the app.
